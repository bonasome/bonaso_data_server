Next Steps:
Now:
    Backend server is passing tests and has a decent amount of validations, though updates and some perms haven't been tested as thoroughly.

File Uploads:
    Simple model that takes files and allows admins to download. 

Meeting:
    Once the frontend is reasonably set up as to do some demos, I need to meet with the ME team to figure out some specific wordings and make sure the general app flow meets all needs.
